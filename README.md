### Problem Statement

Housing Development Board (HDB) flats are a type of public housing in Singapore. They are highly sought after by both Singaporean citizens and permanent residents due to their affordability and various amenities provided by the government.

Real estate agents play a crucial role in facilitating the buying and selling of properties, including HDB flats. Their expertise and knowledge of the local market are essential in helping clients make informed decisions and achieve the best possible outcomes. To effectively serve their clients and maximize their business potential, real estate agents need accurate and reliable price predictions for HDB flats.

To address this need, our team of data scientists has been engaged by a group of real estate agents who are planning to establish their own real estate agency. They have specifically identified HDB flats as their primary focus and want us to develop a price prediction model tailored to this housing type. The aim of our data science project is to create a robust and accurate price prediction model for HDB flats. The successful implementation of this price prediction model will enable the real estate agents to make data-driven decisions, offer competitive pricing recommendations, attract more clients, and establish themselves as trusted advisors in the HDB market.

### Conclusion

1) Our production model can accurately and reliably predict HDB resale prices
2) Floor area, number of nearby hawkers, and floor level are the strongest positive predictors of resale prices
3) HDB age, location, and distance from MRT are the strongest negative predictors of resale prices

### Recommendations

1. To maximise commissions for the least effort, the agency may wish to leverage the prediction model and consider different strategies at the town, neighbourhood and block/unit levels. 

2. Up-play positive features during pitch to prospective sellers and buyers (i.e. maximising buyers/sellersâ€™ returns) 

3. Regularly provide content on features of interest (e.g. electronic direct mail, news and articles) to prospective clients

### Next steps

As our ageing population increases, how would this affect the demand for larger homes if homeowners retire, incomes are smaller and the children have all moved out? We can also further analyse and improve our prediction model with additional data such as age and gender of HDB owners.
